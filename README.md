Mobile Responsive Navbar

This is some basic code for a Mobile Responsive Navbar that will react to the changing landscape of a website or smart phone. The Navbar will stack up as the screen size gets smaller and present a hamburger menu that when clicked will show a dropdown Navbar with links.

The links have a cool hover effect as well.
